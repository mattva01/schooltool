===================================================
System-Integration of Commentations into SchoolTool
===================================================

Now that we have integrated the commendations on the Python level, we need to
complete this integration in the system. The goal of this section will be to
make the commendations viewable and addable in the Web UI.

While it is perfectly possible to *configure* SchoolTool components using Python
directly, it is never done. Instead, there is a special configuration language
called the Zope Configuration Markup Language, or ZCML. The intention here is
that the configuration can be easily overridden and changed.  This chapter will
introduce you to some of the responsibilities and features of ZCML.

By convention, all configuration is placed into a file called
``configure.zcml``. If your package contains sub-packages, there is a
``<include package="..." />`` directive that allows you to link in other
configuration files. You can see that our package also has such a file. Since
ZCML is a XML dialect, configuration directives are grouped into XML
namespaces. Short names for the used namespaces inside a configuration file
are commonly declared in the wrapping ``<configure>`` element as can be seen
in ``configure.zcml``.

Once the configuration file is created, you need a way to tell the system:
"Hey, here is a new ZCML file." This is handled by placing a forwarding
configuration file -- usually called ``<package>-configure.zcml`` -- into a
special directory; in this case ``SCHOOLTOOL/etc/schooltool-skel``. To
automate the task, create a ``SETUP.cfg`` file as demonstrated in the
package. When you type ``make`` or ``python setup.py build``, the forwarding
configuration file is automatically placed into the aforementioned directory.


ZCML Registration of new Components
-----------------------------------

The primary objective of ZCML is to register components. In the previous
chapter, we registered our component, the ``IHaveCommendations`` adapter,
using Python directly. For the final system integration, we register the
adapter using the ``<adapter>`` directive. Most of its attributes should be
obvious. The ``trusted`` argument causes the adapted object (in other words
the context of the adapter) to not be proxied, but the result from calling the
adapter (in this case the ``Commendations`` instance) will be proxied. This is
necessary, since there are no security declarations for the annotation
attribute of the component.

Next we declare the security assignments for the ``Commendation`` and
``Commendations`` class. Since commendations are public, we allow them to be
accessible publically. On the other hand, commendations should never be
editable, so we simple make the commendation API writable only for the
``schooltool.create`` permission. Note that those settings are true for both
classes. The ``<content>`` directive is commonly used to make such
declarations. The ``<allow>`` sub-directives makes the specified attributes
public for access. If an interface is specified, all fields and methods will
be made public. The ``<require>`` directive is very similar to the previous
one, except that it allows one to specify the permission under which the
attributes are accessible. As you can see, we are using the ``set_schema``
attribute here, since we want to say that all fields in the given schema are
only writable with the specified permission.

Finally, we have to tell the system which objects will be able to have
commendations. This is done by simply asserting the implementation of the
``IHaveCommendations`` interface on the desired classes. As specified in Tom's
requirement E-mail, all persons, groups and sections should be able to get
commendations. Thus, you can see the three ``<class>`` directives with an
``<implements>`` directive doing exactely that. If you review the previous
chapter, you will see that we did the same there in Python.


Create an Add and Commendations View
------------------------------------

Now that we have integrated the commendations with the system, we need to
develop some views. The first screen will be the addform. Since commendations
are tucked away in annotations, we cannot use the standard Zope 3 form
machinery for the task without some modifications. In fact, we only need to
change the methods that convert the input data to the object and handle the
forwarding to the next screen. Additionally we have to set a couple of
attributes manually, which usually would be set by the ``<browser:addform>``
directive. You can see the add form view class called ``CommendationAddView``
in the newly created module ``browser.py``.  XXX - generally speaking I think 
you should refer people to the relevant files at the beginning of the paragraph
not at the end.

*Note*: By convention browser-related code is placed in a module called
 ``browser``. If there is a lot of browser code, a package of the same name is
 commonly created. This package does not only contain the Python code, but
 also all other resources, such as icons, templates, etc.

As you can see, the ``CommendationAddView`` class inherits from the
``AddForm`` class, the standard class for add forms. By specifying the schema
``ICommendations`` we tell the forms about the fields whose data must be
collected. This selection can be refined using the ``fieldNames`` attribute,
which specifies the fields and their order to be displayed. Since we do not
want the form to ask for the creation date and the author, we only ask for the
title, description and scope.

Let's now have a look at the methods that are overridden. As you can see in
the first line of the ``commendation_add.pt`` template -- the page template
used for the add form -- the ``update()`` method is the first view class
method that is called. The reson we are overriding it in this case is to
support the additional "Cancel" button.

  >>> from zope.interface import directlyProvides
  >>> from zope.app.traversing.interfaces import IContainmentRoot
  >>> from schooltool.app import app
  >>> st = app.SchoolToolApplication()
  >>> directlyProvides(st, IContainmentRoot)

  >>> from schooltool.person import person
  >>> st['persons']['sue'] = person.Person('sue', 'Sue')

  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest(form={'CANCEL': True})

  >>> from schooltool.commendation import browser
  >>> addform = browser.CommendationAddView(st['persons']['sue'], request)

  >>> addform.update()
  'http://127.0.0.1/persons/sue'

If instead of the "Cancel" button, the "Add" button is clicked, then the
standard ``update()`` method is used. If all values were correctly input, the
``create()`` method is called, which must return the created object:

  >>> comm = addform.create(u'good job', u'very good job.', u'group')
  >>> comm
  <Commendation u'good job' by u'<unknown>'>

After the commendation is created it is added using the ``add()`` method:

  >>> addform.add(comm)
  <Commendation u'good job' by u'<unknown>'>

  >>> from schooltool.commendation import interfaces
  >>> dict(interfaces.ICommendations(st['persons']['sue']).items())
  {u'Commendation': <Commendation u'good job' by u'<unknown>'>}

As you can see the commendation be returned again. Once the real work is done,
``nextURL()`` is called to determine the URL to which the page should be
forwarded.

  >>> addform.nextURL()
  'http://127.0.0.1/persons/sue'

While, as mentioned before, it is custom to use the ``<browser:addform>``
directive to create add forms, our special circumstances require us to use the
more generic ``<browser:page>`` directive. The page directive fulfills several
tasks. It creates the view from the view class and a given template, sets up
security, and registers the page with a menu. In our case, only individuals
having the ``schooltool.create`` permission can add commendations and the
``schooltool_actions`` menu will provide a link for the add form, if the
current user has been granted that permission.

Now that we can add new commendations, we also need a way to view
them. Instead of just writing one large view to render all the commendations
of a a person, group or section, we first write a small view that will create
an HTML snippet that represents one commendation. The view class,
``CommendationDetails``, has only one responsibility: provide UI-friendly
versions of the commendations data. That means that the grantor should not be
an incomprehensible principal id, but the name of the person and the date
should be formatted to the correct locale information of the user. Both of
those requirements are fulfilled in the referenced class.

  >>> details = browser.CommendationDetails()
  >>> details.context = comm
  >>> details.request = request

  >>> details.title
  u'good job'
  >>> details.description
  u'very good job.'
  >>> details.grantor
  u'<unknown>'
  >>> details.date
  u'...'

Combined with the details template, ``commendation.pt``, the view is now
registered using the ``<browser:page>`` directive, even though the view does
not produce a full oage in itself. Also note that Tom specified that
commendations are by definition public, so that the details view has the
permission ``zope.Public``.

The final step is to write a view for ``ICommendations`` that uses the
commendation details view for each commendation. Since commendations are
hidden in an annotation, the commendations view is registered for
``IHaveCommendation``, but in the constructor the view looks up the
commendations and stores them in an attribute. This is done in the
``CommendationsView`` class.

  >>> overview = browser.CommendationsView(st['persons']['sue'], request)
  >>> list(overview.commendations)
  [<Commendation u'good job' by u'<unknown>'>]

Combined with a very short template, here ``commendations.pt``, the overview
is registered as a page again.


Testing Browser UI Code
-----------------------

Browser code can be tested in two ways. One is through unit tests, as we did
in the previous sections as well as this one. All of the above interactive
Python commands are unit tests with the difference that they are run with the
full SchoolTool system setup.

The second way of testing is through functional tests. Functional tests check
the correctness on a higher level. Unit tests are programming tests, while
functional tests are user tests. Ideally, they should be executed in a
browser. And that's exactely what we will do. Zope 3 comes with a component
known as the "test browser", which is a class that represents a little
programmable browser. So here is a typical test:

We get setup by accessing the site and logging in as the manager:

  >>> from zope.testbrowser import Browser
  >>> manager = Browser()
  >>> manager.open('http://localhost/')

  >>> manager.getLink('Log In').click()
  >>> manager.getControl('Username').value = 'manager'
  >>> manager.getControl('Password').value = 'schooltool'
  >>> manager.getControl('Log in').click()

Now that we are locked in, we have to create

- a student,

  >>> manager.getLink('persons').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('New Person').click()
  >>> manager.getControl('Full name').value = 'Tom Hoffman'
  >>> manager.getControl('Username').value = 'tha1'
  >>> manager.getControl('Password').value = 'myohmy'
  >>> manager.getControl('Verify password').value = 'myohmy'
  >>> manager.getControl('Add').click()

- a course,

  >>> manager.getLink('Courses').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('New Course').click()
  >>> manager.getControl('Title').value = 'Math 101'
  >>> manager.getControl('Description').value = 'Basic Math'
  >>> manager.getControl('Identifier').value = 'math101'
  >>> manager.getControl('Add').click()

- and a section.

  >>> manager.getLink('Math 101').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('New Section').click()
  >>> manager.getControl('Code').value = 'Sec-A'
  >>> manager.getControl('Description').value = 'Section A'
  >>> manager.getControl('Identifier').value = 'math101-A'
  >>> manager.getControl('Add').click()

Now we should be able to add commendations to

- persons,

  >>> manager.getLink('Persons').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('Tom Hoffman').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('Add Commendation').click()
  >>> manager.getControl('Title').value = 'Good Job!'
  >>> manager.getControl('Description').value = 'You did a very good job.'
  >>> manager.getControl('Add').click()

  >>> manager.getLink('View Commendations').click()
  >>> print analyze.queryHTML('//div[@class="commendation"]',
  ...                         manager.contents)[0]
  <div class="commendation">
    <h3>Good Job!</h3>
    <div style="font-size: 60%">
      by <span class="grantor">SchoolTool Manager</span>
      on <span class="date">...</span>
    </div>
    <div class="description">You did a very good job.</div>
  </div>

- groups,

  >>> manager.getLink('Groups').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('Students').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('Add Commendation')
  <Link text='Add Commendation' url='...groups/students/@@addCommendation.html'>
  >>> manager.getLink('View Commendations')
  <Link text='View Commendations' url='...groups/students/@@commendations.html'>

- and sections.

  >>> manager.getLink('Sections').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('Sec-A').click()
  >>> manager.getLink('Add Commendation')
  <Link text='Add Commendation' url='...tions/math101-A/@@addCommendation.html'>
  >>> manager.getLink('View Commendations')
  <Link text='View Commendations' url='...tions/math101-A/@@commendations.html'>

Also, not just everybody can add new commendations. For example Tom Hoffman,
one of the students, cannot add new commendations:

  >>> tom = Browser()
  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/')

  >>> tom.getLink('Log In').click()
  >>> tom.getControl('Username').value = 'tha1'
  >>> tom.getControl('Password').value = 'myohmy'
  >>> tom.getControl('Log in').click()

  >>> tom.handleErrors = False
  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/persons/manager/@@addCommendation.html')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  Unauthorized: ...

  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/groups/students/@@addCommendation.html')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  Unauthorized: ...

  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/sections/math101-A/@@addCommendation.html')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  Unauthorized: ...

On the other hand, since the commendations are public, he can view them:

  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/persons/manager/@@commendations.html')
  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/groups/students/@@commendations.html')
  >>> tom.open('http://localhost/sections/math101-A/@@commendations.html')

And that's all.
