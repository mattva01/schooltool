Grade levels
===============

A simple implementation to define a set of courses taught to
students at a given level.  This concept is implemented by linking a
level to a course.

Ability to define a student's level, as well as any UI whatsoever,
are not implemented yet, so levels are pretty useless at this point.

Level data model
----------------

There is a root container, initialized on application startup.

    >>> from schooltool.app.interfaces import ISchoolToolApplication
    >>> from schooltool.app.interfaces import ApplicationInitializationEvent
    >>> from schooltool.app.main import initializeSchoolToolPlugins

    >>> app = ISchoolToolApplication(None)
    >>> initializeSchoolToolPlugins(ApplicationInitializationEvent(app))

    >>> sorted(app.keys())
    ['schooltool.level.level', 'schooltool.schoolyear']

    >>> app['schooltool.level.level']
    <schooltool.level.level.LevelContainer ...>

Levels are stored in it.

You can adapt the application to ILevelContainer to get the levels
container.

    >>> from schooltool.level.interfaces import ILevelContainer
    >>> levels = ILevelContainer(app)
    >>> print levels
    <schooltool.level.level.LevelContainer ...>

Levels themselves are simple objects with a title.

    >>> from schooltool.level.level import Level
    >>> levels['2'] = Level(u'Second-year')
    >>> levels['1'] = Level(u'First-year')
    >>> levels['3'] = Level(u'Third-year')

    >>> [level.title for level in levels.values()]
    [u'Second-year', u'First-year', u'Third-year']

Level containers are ordered.

    >>> levels.updateOrder(['1', '2', '3'])
    >>> [level.title for level in levels.values()]
    [u'First-year', u'Second-year', u'Third-year']


Linking levels to courses
-------------------------

Levels are linked to courses via schooltool.relationship.  There
is a helper attribute to manage the relationships.

    >>> math = CourseStub('Math')

    >>> level_1 = levels['1']
    >>> level_1.courses.add(math)

    >>> level_2 = levels['2']
    >>> level_2.courses.add(math)

    >>> from schooltool.level.level import URILevelCourses, URILevel
    >>> print [level.title
    ...     for level in getRelatedObjects(
    ...         math, URILevel, rel_type=URILevelCourses)]
    [u'First-year', u'Second-year']


Helpers
-------

If you need a dropdown of levels in a form, there is a special
level vocabulary.

    >>> from zope.schema import Choice
    >>> levels_field = Choice(
    ...    title=u"Levels",
    ...    vocabulary='schooltool.level.level.levelvocabulary')

    >>> context = None
    >>> levels = levels_field.bind(context)

    >>> for term in levels.vocabulary:
    ...     print '%s: %s' % (term.token, term.title)
    1-: First-year
    2-: Second-year
    3-: Third-year

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyObject
    >>> from zope.schema.interfaces import IVocabularyTokenized
    >>> verifyObject(IVocabularyTokenized, levels.vocabulary)
    True
